## Conversation Two
W: Today on People in the News, our guest is John Williams. The name may not sound familiar to you, but John was once
an acclaimed basketball player. John, you stunned fans by leaving the sport at just 25. Why did you retire so early?
M: Meg, I loved being an athlete, but I didn't love being a celebrity. I was in the limelight when I was still a high
school student and went professional right after high school graduation, which was a mistake. [5] I was a shy kid
and I wasn't ready fbr all the media attention.
W: But walking away from millions of dollars at the height of your career, most people wouldn't be able to resist the
lure of such a high salary. When you left the sport, there was speculation that you were having issues with your
teammates or even an injury.
M: Not at all. It was hard to quit. I was tempted to stay in the game, because I love basketball and I loved my team.
As for money, I turned professional at 18. So Td actually earned a lot and saved most of it, because I had great
financial advisers. [6] I knew basketball wasn't a career with a lot of longevity fbr most players, so I wanted to
change careers while I was still young.
W: [7] Okay, that was 20 years ago, and you're back in the news. You've created a foundation that works to get more
kids playing team sports. Why?
M: I went to university and I studied public health and learned about the seriousness of the obesity epidemic,
particularly among kids and adolescents in poor communities. [8] I've spent the last two decades trying to alleviate
the problem. The foundation isjust the latest attempt.
W: The foundation uses private donations to support basketball teams for girls and boys in primary school, right?
M: Actually, we support teams for secondary school students, too, and also have some public funding.
