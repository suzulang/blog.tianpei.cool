## Conversation Two
<p>W: Today on People in the News, our guest is John Williams. The name may not sound familiar to you, but John was once</p>
<p>an acclaimed basketball player. John, you stunned fans by leaving the sport at just 25. Why did you retire so early?</p>
<p>M: Meg, I loved being an athlete, but I didn't love being a celebrity. I was in the limelight when I was still a high</p>
<p>school student and went professional right after high school graduation, which was a mistake. [5] I was a shy kid</p>
<p>and I wasn't ready fbr all the media attention.</p>
<p>W: But walking away from millions of dollars at the height of your career, most people wouldn't be able to resist the</p>
<p>lure of such a high salary. When you left the sport, there was speculation that you were having issues with your</p>
<p>teammates or even an injury.</p>
<p>M: Not at all. It was hard to quit. I was tempted to stay in the game, because I love basketball and I loved my team.</p>
<p>As for money, I turned professional at 18. So Td actually earned a lot and saved most of it, because I had great</p>
<p>financial advisers. [6] I knew basketball wasn't a career with a lot of longevity fbr most players, so I wanted to</p>
<p>change careers while I was still young.</p>
<p>W: [7] Okay, that was 20 years ago, and you're back in the news. You've created a foundation that works to get more</p>
<p>kids playing team sports. Why?</p>
<p>M: I went to university and I studied public health and learned about the seriousness of the obesity epidemic,</p>
<p>particularly among kids and adolescents in poor communities. [8] I've spent the last two decades trying to alleviate</p>
<p>the problem. The foundation is just the latest attempt.</p>
<p>W: The foundation uses private donations to support basketball teams for girls and boys in primary school, right?</p>
<p>M: Actually, we support teams for secondary school students, too, and also have some public funding.</p>
