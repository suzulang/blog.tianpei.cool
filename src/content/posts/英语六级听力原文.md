## Conversation Two
<p>W: Today on People in the News, our guest is John Williams. The name may not sound familiar to you, but John was once</p>
<p>an acclaimed basketball player. John, you stunned fans by leaving the sport at just 25. Why did you retire so early?</p>
<p>M: Meg, I loved being an athlete, but I didn't love being a celebrity. I was in the limelight when I was still a high</p>
<p>school student and went professional right after high school graduation, which was a mistake. [5] I was a shy kid</p>
<p>and I wasn't ready fbr all the media attention.</p>
<p>W: But walking away from millions of dollars at the height of your career, most people wouldn't be able to resist the</p>
<p>lure of such a high salary. When you left the sport, there was speculation that you were having issues with your</p>
<p>teammates or even an injury.</p>
<p>M: Not at all. It was hard to quit. I was tempted to stay in the game, because I love basketball and I loved my team.</p>
<p>As for money, I turned professional at 18. So Td actually earned a lot and saved most of it, because I had great</p>
<p>financial advisers. [6] I knew basketball wasn't a career with a lot of longevity fbr most players, so I wanted to</p>
<p>change careers while I was still young.</p>
<p>W: [7] Okay, that was 20 years ago, and you're back in the news. You've created a foundation that works to get more</p>
<p>kids playing team sports. Why?</p>
<p>M: I went to university and I studied public health and learned about the seriousness of the obesity epidemic,</p>
<p>particularly among kids and adolescents in poor communities. [8] I've spent the last two decades trying to alleviate</p>
<p>the problem. The foundation is just the latest attempt.</p>
<p>W: The foundation uses private donations to support basketball teams for girls and boys in primary school, right?</p>
<p>M: Actually, we support teams for secondary school students, too, and also have some public funding.</p>

# Section B
## Passage One
Kate Atkinson was born in York, England, in 1951. She worked hard to gain her credentials as an author. She studied English Literature at University in Scotland. After graduating in 1974, she researched a doctorate on American Literature. Later, she taught at the university she graduated from, and began writing short stories in 1981.

<p>She began writing for women's magazines after winning the 1986 Woman's Own Short Story Competition. Her first novel, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, won the 1995 UK Book of the Year award. The book is set in Yorkshire and has been adapted for radio, theatre, and TV. She has written two plays for a theatre in Edinburgh—the first was called Nice and the second Abandonment, performed as part of the Edinburgh Festival in August 2000.</p>

<p>Whatever genre Atkinson writes in, her books touch on the themes of love and loss and how to carry on. They are always presented with ingenuity and a wicked sense of humor. Her books tend to be populated by odd, sometimes sinful, and generally flawed eccentrics who become credible by virtue of being so fully realized. Her books have frequently been described as comedies of manners. That is to say, comedies that represent the complex and sophisticated code of behaviour current in fashionable circles of society, where appearances count more than true moral character.</p>

<p>A comedy of manners tends to reward its clever and deceitful characters, rather than punish their bad deeds. The humor of a comedy of manners relies on verbal wit and playful teasing.</p>
